title: Mod Users, READ THIS
---
I've had enough of this around the forums, so I'm doing this as a favor for all modders out there.

If you use someone's mods and want to ask for an update, **read this first** so you can avoid being yelled at.

If you're a modder and you use someone's mods and are actually thinking about pressuring them on an update, I really don't understand your logic. Read this and see if your mind changes.



As a modder, I rely on a few sections of the community to develop my mods, as Minecraft looks like [this](https://gist.github.com/kenzierocks/0e95df56e3a5ccb2c124) normally. Can you read that? Do you understand what it does? I don't.

But I can use something like [MCP](http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/page.php?4) to turn this into something readable. That un-readable code has become [this](https://gist.github.com/kenzierocks/05a8c19f1df67e355087) readable code. This code is very easy to understand and can be understood by anyone with basic Java knowledge. Make sure that MCP has an [update posted on their site](http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/download.php?list.2) before even touching any mod threads. The only modder I know that worked without MCP is Rigusami (author of ModLoader). If MCP has no update, then mods will have no updates.

After you check MCP, then check whatever the mod depends upon. If it's nothing, then the mod might already be updating! If it's [Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/index.php?board=3.0) or [LiteLoader](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1290155-liteloader-for-minecraft-1-7-10), check with the respective page first. If there are other libraries I haven't mentioned here, follow the same rules.

Once all that is checked, then you know that the stage is set for the mod author to update. But you still can't even touch on that subject. It's against the rules.
MCF ["Mapping and Modding Rules"](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/forums/forum-discussion-info/2128381-mapping-and-modding-rules):
> Do not ask, demand or pressure creators to update their mods, this includes asking if/when there will be an update, and applies well for downgrades

So just don't ask on the forums. But at least now you can tell when you should expect an update.
