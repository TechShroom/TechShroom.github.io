title: Generic Hendrix v1.0
---

Generic Hendrix, Version 1.0 is here! This tool allows you add generic signature data into compiled Java bytecode from special configuration files. This is useful mostly in the case of the Minecraft Coder Pack, which always works on the same source set, but is useful for any project that decompiles the same source set over and over.

In the future there are plans to automate the generic signature data resolving, allowing it to be included as part of a standard decompilation tool.

You can get version 1.0 right [here]({% include localmaven.html ref="com.techshroom:GenericHendrix:1.0.0" host="" %}). A Getting Started guide is available [here](/docs/generic-hendrix/guides/manual.html).
