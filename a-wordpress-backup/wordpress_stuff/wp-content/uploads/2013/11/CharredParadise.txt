Charred Paradise - Game idea

Just an idea. No need to actually follow it.

Charred Paradise was a game project I was working on a while ago, as a sort of way to learn LWJGL and OpenGL. It was abandoned but I still have the code. It needs major reworks and stuff. 

 o---o--GAMEPLAY--o---o
The basic idea of the game was that it was a 2d platformer shoot em up, sort of like Cave Story but with better graphics. The player would control a crashed being on an alien planet. They would find weapons along their journey, ranging from swords to laser sniper rifles. These weapons would be upgraded along the journey through a mechanic called Essentia. (See "Essentia System")

Essentia:
Essentia is the method for upgrading weapons. It is a glowy orb. If something dies, the essentia it has collected is dropped. Enemies can pick up essentia as well. So if a monster kills a ton of sheep, it will become stronger. Taking damage looses essentia. Picking up essentia will insert it into your weapon. Get enough, your weapon will level up. Sword becomes a beam sword. Beam sword becomes a plasma fist that shoots lasers on a charge shot. Simple laser pistol becomes a better laser pistol, which becomes an even better laser pistol. Etc.

o---o--Storyline--o---o
The player would begin in a smoking crater inside an escape pod, in an area known as the Forest Shrine. They wander for a bit, and eventually find a rough sword that they can use as a weapon. They travel across the planet, meeting the native inteligent species and discovering the secrets of a lost human colony. 

Eventually, they would come across the crashed colony ship that brought them here in the first place. In it, they learn about the purpose of the colony ship; it was meant to bring a deadly disease to the natives the player has befriended to wipe them out, making room for human settlement. They also learn who came up with the plan for the disease, who becomes the game's primary antagonist (Actually, antagonist might be female. Getting away from gender bias is always good. But not like, scantily clad female. Just, you know, female scientist gone crazy. ).

The player makes their way back to the dead human settlement on the surface, and finds it isn't completely dead. It has been made to look abandoned so that the colonists (Not the ones of the crashed colony ship), will not have to infect the natives with the disease they too cary. With their help, the player steals medical supplies from the colony ship, and treats the disease. Disease-free, the player will go to the native village, to find it is already infected with the disease. All but one native lays dead or dying. The remaining one (who is immune) tells of a legend about the Essentia Core, the being that controlls all essentia on the planet. If the player could kill it, the natives could be resurrected. 

The player ventures down to confront the Core, releasing all the Essentia on the planet. The antagonist siphons this energy into his own being, becoming super-powered. The player is left with no other choice but to merge with the Core, becoming super-powered as well. The final battle commences, and as the Player defeats the Antagonist, the essentia is again freed, reviving the natives. The Player-Core, unstable after being wounded before the merge, dies. 

If the player has reached certain conditions, in it's dying moments, the player-core is sent Essentia transfusions from all they have helped. The humans, the natives, and others, all meet in the core's chamber. The hero is ressurected in a limbo-state, and finds a hidden passage has opened beneath the core.

Welcome to The Reactor. The planet we lived on was not a planet. It was a machine. The Essentia, it's blood. We were like fleas, biting at it's skin. The Antagonist knew this. He sought greater power, the power to conquer the planet itself, and force it to obey his will. And in doing so, the planet woke. The Reactor is online. And it is not happy. You are the infection, and it has millions of white blood cells to knock you out. The player finds a way to the Reactor, and after a climactic battle, shuts it down forever. The planet may or may not explode, I'm undecided.
